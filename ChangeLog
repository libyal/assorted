TODO
* create xor tool that will byte-wise xor a file using a "key"
* create equivalent of sigfind that is more powerful
  can handle more than 4 byte signatures
* create lz1decompress (or equiv) for NSF compression

* decompression tools and code
  - clean up, make stand-alone libs
  - add compression equiv
  - move ntfs compression to lznt1.[ch]
  - move all the decompression into one tool?

* lznt1decompress
  - add support for source size
  - merge with other decompress tools

* zdecompress
  - zdecompress enlarge buffer when zlib uncompress fails (size uncompressed = 81 x size compressed)
  - add support for adler

lzxpressdecompress
- allow to set size of decompressed data

* xor64
  - check/fix mode 2
* fix winapi build on cygwin
* use PRI definions for winapi build E.g. %jd
* change 7-bit ascii into 7-bit
* 2011 update
* move data dump to verbose output
* automatically detect file size

Alder-32
* finish SIMD variant

CRC-32
* implement basic (scalar) CRC-32 calculation method
* implement basic (scalar) weak CRC-32 calculation method
* add mod2 polynomial support

Fletcher-16
* finish fletcher16

Filetime:
* create equivalent tool in libfdatetime
